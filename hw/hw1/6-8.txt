6.8 Assume that the time needed to send an n-byte message is X + n/f.
Write a program implementing the "ping pong" test to determine X
(latency) and f (bandwidth) on your parallel computer.
 Design the
program to run on exactly two processes. 

Process 0 records the time and then sends a message to process 1. 
After process 1 receives the message,it immediately sends it back to process 0. 
Process 0 receives the message and records the time. 

The elapsed time divided by 2 is the average
message-passing time. Try sending messages multiple times, and
experiment with messages of different lengths, to generate enough data
points that you can estimate X and /?.
